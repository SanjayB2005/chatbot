# üîê Security Setup Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: GitHub Push Protection

Your push was blocked because the `service-account-key.json` file contains sensitive Google Cloud credentials. This is a security feature to protect your secrets.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix This

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Your environment is already configured!**
   - The `.env.local` file contains your actual API keys and secrets
   - The `.env` file contains only placeholder values (safe for git)
   - Python services automatically load `.env.local` first, then `.env` as fallback

2. **File Structure:**
   ```
   ai-service/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env              ‚Üê Placeholder values (tracked by git)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.local        ‚Üê Your actual secrets (ignored by git)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service-account-key.json ‚Üê Your Google Cloud key (ignored by git)
   ```

3. **Verify your setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ai-service
   python -c "import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv('.env.local'); load_dotenv(); print('API Key loaded:', 'Yes' if os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', '').startswith('AIza') else 'No')"
   ```

### Step 2: Keep Your Service Account Key Secure

The `service-account-key.json` file is now in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to GitHub. You have two options:

#### Option A: Keep the Local File (Recommended for Development)
- Keep your `service-account-key.json` file locally
- Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=ai-service/service-account-key.json` in your `.env` file
- The file will be ignored by git and not pushed to GitHub

#### Option B: Use Environment Variables (Recommended for Production)
- Extract the contents of your service account key and set them as environment variables
- This is more secure for production deployments

### Step 3: Configure Your Environment

1. **Make sure you have your actual Gemini API key**
2. **Update the `.env` file with your real credentials**
3. **Test the connection:**
   ```bash
   cd ai-service
   python -c "from services.gemini_service import GeminiService; print('‚úÖ Service configured successfully')"
   ```

## üöÄ Resume Development

After setting up your environment variables:

1. **Commit the security fixes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: remove service account key from git and add security setup"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Start your services:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: AI Service
   cd ai-service
   python main.py

   # Terminal 2: Backend
   cd server
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 3: Frontend  
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
